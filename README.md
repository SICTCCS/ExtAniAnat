External Animal Anatomy Quiz Game


# How to add more Animals
This quiz was made using scratch. All of the core mechanics of the game are all built out and ready to be copy and pasted to the other animals.

**Step 1, Joining Scrach** <br>
- Go to Scratch.com
- Click "Join Scratch" and create an account
- Then, click this link to go to the [Scratch Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/885605066)
- Click the "See inside button" on the project page.
- If you are signed into your account, there should be a remix button on the top of the page, click that to make a copy.
- Congradulations! You made a copy of the project and are ready to start making your animal.

  
**Step 2, Changing the code** <br>
- Open the remix file under the "My Stuff" section in your account.
- Now that you are inside the file, look to the left side of the screen where it says "sprites"
- There are going to be many sprites, but the main sprite you are going to be messing with is called "Question"
- The "Question" sprite contains about 90% of the code for the game, you will not need to mess with the code for the other sprites.
